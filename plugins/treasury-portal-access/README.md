# Treasury Portal Access

This plugin adds an access gate for protected content using a Contact Form 7 form. Visitors who complete the form receive a browser cookie and optional localStorage record that grants them access for a configurable duration.

## Installation

1. Copy this folder to your WordPress `wp-content/plugins` directory or upload the ZIP through **Plugins → Add New**.
2. Ensure the [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) plugin is installed and activated.
3. Activate **Treasury Portal Access** from the Plugins screen.
4. Go to **Portal Access → Settings** in the WordPress admin and choose your Contact Form 7 form.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or later
- PHP 7.4 or later
- Contact Form 7

## Quick Start

1. Create or select a Contact Form 7 form with fields for name and email.
2. In **Portal Access → Settings**, select that form and adjust the access duration and redirect URL if needed.
3. Place the `[portal_button]` shortcode on any page to display a button that opens the access form modal.
4. Wrap restricted content within `[protected_content]` tags so only users with an active access cookie can see it.

## Shortcode Reference

```
[protected_content]Your content here...[/protected_content]
```
Displays content only to users who have granted access. You can also specify `content_ids` or `video_ids` to embed protected items:

```
[protected_content content_ids="https://youtu.be/abc123,https://example.com/file.mp4"]
```

```
[portal_button text="Get Portal Access"]
```
Inserts a button that opens the access form modal.

```
<a href="#openPortalModal">Access Portal</a>
```
Manually trigger the modal from a custom link or button.

Once a visitor completes the form they are redirected to your chosen page and can view any content wrapped in `protected_content` for the configured number of days.
