# Username Leaderboard

Provides a simple shortcode to display all registered WordPress users.

## Usage

1. Copy the `username-leaderboard` folder into your site's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate **Username Leaderboard** from the Plugins screen.
3. Add the shortcode `[username_leaderboard]` to any post or page.

The plugin automatically lists all users ordered by registration date. No submit button is required; user data loads directly from the database.
